# Library Project

## Briefing
- The goal is to code a Library App using Front End technologies
- The Library App should contain functionality to add new books, to remove the books already included and change status of each book

## Highs
- I like the color palette and overall visuals
- [Modern fonts are absolutely awesome and aesthetic](https://modernfontstacks.com/)
- I learned how to properly search for the index of an object in an array
- I felt like I quite knew what I was doing throughout the project
- I planned and prepared for the project well

## Lows
- The project is broken on smaller screen sizes, however responsivness wasn't a requirement here
